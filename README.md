# Evidence Template Project


The `selinuxRelabel: "shared"` line tells Podman to automatically manage the SELinux context of the host directory, ensuring the container has the necessary permissions to read and write files without manual configuration.


The `args` field in the manifest contains a series of commands that are run in sequence to prepare and start the development server.

The command is:
`npm install && npm run sources && npm run dev -- --host`

This single line tells the container to perform three separate actions, one after the other. It's a key part of making this setup simple and reliable. 

#### Command Breakdown

- **`npm install`**: This command downloads and installs the project's dependencies from `package.json` into the `node_modules` directory. The first time you run this, it will take some time to download everything. On subsequent runs, it will be much faster as it only installs what's missing or changed. 💡 For a more consistent and faster build, especially in CI/CD, you could use `npm ci` instead, which performs a "clean install" based strictly on the `package-lock.json` file.
- **`&&`**: This is a logical operator. It tells the shell to run the next command **only if the previous one was successful**. This ensures the dev server doesn't start before the dependencies are installed and the data sources are ready.
- **`npm run sources`**: This command is specific to the Evidence framework. It processes the raw data files in your `/sources` directory and generates the necessary files for the application to use. This step is required for the application to have data to display.
- **`npm run dev`**: This starts the Vite development server. It watches for changes in your project files and automatically reloads the application in your browser.
- **`-- --host`**: This is the most important part for networking. The first `--` is a special syntax that tells `npm` to pass all following arguments directly to the script being run (in this case, `npm run dev`). The `--host` flag then tells the Vite dev server to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. This makes the server accessible from your host machine's browser, allowing you to view your project at `http://localhost:3000`.
